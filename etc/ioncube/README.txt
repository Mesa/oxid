                            The ionCube Loader 
                            ------------------

* ionCube Loaders

* a Loader Wizard script to assist with Loader installation (loader-wizard.php)

* the License document for use of the Loader and encoded files (LICENSE.txt)

* User Guide (new with Loader 5). The Loader operates as an extension to
  PHP, and has options that can be configured through the php.ini file.
